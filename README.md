# Credit-card-fraud-detection-project

Credit card fraud is a pervasive issue, and its incidence has been escalating in recent years. With projections indicating that we may surpass a billion credit card users by the end of 2022, the need for robust fraud detection mechanisms is more critical than ever. Fortunately, advancements in technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science have empowered credit card companies to detect and prevent fraudulent activities with impressive accuracy.

The core idea behind these advanced detection systems is to analyze the usual spending behaviors of customers, including the geographical locations of their transactions, to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent activities. By leveraging sophisticated algorithms and models, these systems can learn to identify anomalies that signify potential fraud.
